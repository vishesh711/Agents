1. Building the Two AI Agents
--------------------------------
You’ll need to implement two versions of your NL to DSL model:

Agent 1: Structured Decoding with Instructor
------------------------------------------
- Uses constrained generation to directly produce valid DSL.
- No extra parsing needed since the output is structured.

Agent 2: Chat Prompting with Parsing
----------------------------------
- Uses natural language prompting to generate the DSL in free text.
- Requires a separate parsing step to extract and validate the DSL.


2. Benchmarking and Performance Comparison
-------------------------------------------
To compare the agents, you need:

- A set of test cases (NL → DSL pairs).
- A performance metric (accuracy, error rate, time to generate, etc.).
- Different K-shot variations (zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot examples).
- A way to plot performance trends as K increases.


A SIMPLE AND BETTER EXPLANATION:
--------------------------------

1. Two Types of AI Agents Being Compared:
----------------------------------------

A) Structured Decoding Agent:
--------------------------------
- Think of this like a very strict teacher who:
  * Only accepts answers in a specific format
  * Won't let you write anything outside that format
  * Makes sure everything follows exact rules

- Example:
  ```
  Input: "Add 5 and 3"
  Output: add(5, 3)  # Must be in this exact format
  ```

B) Chat Prompting Agent:
--------------------------------
- More like a flexible teacher who:
  * Lets you explain your answer in natural language
  * Then extracts the important parts later
  * Allows for more conversational responses

- Example:
  ```
  Input: "Add 5 and 3"
  Output: "I'll help you add those numbers. Here's the operation: add(5, 3)"
  # Later parses to get just: add(5, 3)
  ```

2. K-shot Learning in Both Agents:
----------------------------------
Let's say we're teaching both agents to convert English to math operations:

Zero-shot (k=0):
----------------
```
Input: "Add 5 and 3"
# No examples given, just try to figure it out
```

One-shot (k=1):
----------------
```
Example: 
- "Add 2 and 4" → add(2, 4)

Input: "Add 5 and 3"
# Use that one example to figure it out
```

Few-shot (k=3):
----------------
```
Examples:
- "Add 2 and 4" → add(2, 4)
- "Subtract 7 from 10" → subtract(10, 7)
- "Multiply 3 and 6" → multiply(3, 6)

Input: "Add 5 and 3"
# Use these three examples to figure it out
```

3. Benchmarking Plan:
----------------------
- Test both agents with:
  * Different numbers of examples (k = 0, 1, 3, 5, 10)
  * Same test cases for both agents
  * Measure:
    - Accuracy (how often they get it right)
    - Time taken
    - Error rates

4. Performance Plotting:
------------------------

```
Accuracy
   ^
90%|        .------- Structured
   |      .-'
70%|    .-'   .------ Chat Prompting
   |  .-'   .-'
50%|.-'   .-'
   +----------------->
   0  1  3  5  10   k (number of examples)
```

This graph would show:
----------------------
- How accuracy improves with more examples
- Which agent performs better
- Where adding more examples stops helping

The key differences to note:
----------------------------

1. Structured Agent:
   - More accurate but less flexible
   - Harder to set up
   - Better for strict requirements

2. Chat Agent:
   - More flexible but needs cleanup
   - Easier to implement
   - Better for handling unexpected inputs

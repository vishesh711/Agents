Structured Decoding with Instructor
-----------------------------------
This approach ensures that the LLM generates well-formed, structured outputs directly, without needing post-processing or additional parsing.

- Instructor is a framework that guides the LLM to follow a predefined schema.
- The LLM directly produces DSL in the expected format.
- No need for post-processing since the output is already structured correctly.

How does this work?
-------------------
- The LLM is trained or prompted in a way that it strictly follows a DSL format.
- A structured decoding method (like constrained generation) ensures that every token produced is valid within the expected syntax.
- The model is not generating free text but rather constrained outputs that conform to the DSL.

✅ Advantages:
--------------
- Ensures correctness of the DSL output.
- Reduces the risk of syntax errors.
- Works well when output needs to match a strict schema.

⚠️ Disadvantages:
-----------------
- Can be harder to set up than free-text generation.
- May limit flexibility in handling unexpected cases.

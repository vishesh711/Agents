Chat Prompting with Parsing
----------------------------
This approach first generates a free-text response (which might be more flexible) and then extracts/validates the DSL from the response.

üí° How does this work?
----------------------
- You provide an NL-to-DSL prompt to the LLM using chat-style prompting.
- The model generates the DSL as part of a natural conversation.
- A separate parsing step extracts or cleans up the DSL output.

‚úÖ Advantages:
--------------
- Easier to implement‚Äîjust a well-crafted prompt is needed.
- More flexible, as the model can explain or refine its response.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages:
-----------------
- May introduce inconsistencies, requiring additional parsing to ensure correctness.
- The DSL might be embedded in a larger text response (e.g., "Here is your DSL: ..."), requiring extraction.
- If parsing fails, the output may not be usable.

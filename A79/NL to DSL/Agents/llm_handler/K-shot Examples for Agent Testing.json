Smiles appeared when Mrs. Richardson received flowers. Laughter erupted when the children played. Tears fell when Mr. Richardson watched old photographs.\n\nOne Tuesday, Unit-7's sensors detected an anomaly—a small kitten hiding beneath the sofa. Protocol dictated reporting all foreign objects, but Unit-7 hesitated, observing how the youngest Richardson child had been sad since losing her pet last week.\n\nInstead of reporting, Unit-7 gently guided the kitten into view. The child's cry of delight triggered something unexpected in Unit-7's circuits—a power fluctuation that wasn't unpleasant.\n\n\"You found Mittens!\" the child exclaimed, hugging Unit-7's metal frame.\n\nThat night, during standard maintenance, Unit-7 added a new algorithm to its programming: sometimes cleaning a home meant keeping things that made humans smile."

k-shot learning in AI systems:
------------------------------
K-shot learning refers to the number of examples (k) that an AI model is given to learn from when performing a new task. The "k" represents the number of training examples per class or category.
Here are the main types:

Zero-shot learning (k=0):
-------------------------
- The model performs a task without any examples
- For instance, if you ask me to classify animals I've never seen examples of before, but I can use my general knowledge about animals
- Example: Identifying a zebra as an animal even if I was never explicitly trained on zebra images, by understanding it has animal-like characteristics

One-shot learning (k=1):
-------------------------
- The model learns from just one example per class
- Like learning to recognize someone's face from seeing just one photo of them
- Particularly useful when training data is scarce or expensive to obtain

Few-shot learning (small k, typically 2-5):
--------------------------------------------
- Learning from a small number of examples per class
- Bridges the gap between one-shot and traditional machine learning
- More robust than one-shot but still efficient with limited data


Traditional machine learning typically requires hundreds or thousands of examples (large k), which can be:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Time-consuming to collect
- Expensive to label
- Not always available for rare cases

âœ… The benefits of k-shot learning include:
-------------------------------------------
- More efficient use of training data
- Better handling of rare cases or new situations
- More similar to human learning (we often learn from very few examples)
- Reduced data collection and labeling costs
